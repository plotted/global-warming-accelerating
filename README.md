## Data

The source of the data is NOAA Global Time Series

<https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series>

Time series 1850 - 2024 available in 3 formats: CSV, JSON, and XML. We
decided to keep it simple and work with the CSV file:

<https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series/globe/tavg/land_ocean/1/0/1850-2024/data.csv>

A local copy of this CSV file is in the `data/` folder of this github
repository.
